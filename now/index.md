I finallyy finished this site using github pages, jekyll and the jasper2 theme after about 2 weeks. This was a great learning experience. I learnt alot about domains, DNS, Zone Editors, HTTPS certification, Ruby, YAML, HTML, CSS, Javascript, SCSS, YML, MD , GIT, GitHub and so much about patience which is the topic of my email newsletter this week. 

I have exams coming up so I need to study for those using effective study methods and make sure that I do not fall to the trap of studying too much only to get diminishing returns. 

Also I have been reading alot more books now due to the power of audiobooks. I managed to read 2 books in 2 days which is a new personal best. Those are Think Big by Donald Trump and the Ride of a Lifetime by Bob Iger. I will share more thoughts in my upcoming book notes about those books.

That's it.
