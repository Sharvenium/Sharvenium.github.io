I recently started reading Happy by Derren Brown which explores the idea of being happy in today&#8217;s society. The book starts off with the concept that **we are each the product of the stories that we tell ourselves**.<!--more-->

For example, you tell yourself that those who did well in the exams probably have no life and study for 15 hours each day or you tell yourself that your boss does not appreciate your work as he is biased towards your colleagues. However, that might not be the case at all.

So now that we know that **we are each the product of the stories that we tell ourselves,** we can modify these stories to help us to accomplish our goals and dreams. Maybe those who studied well in exams prioritized exams more than hanging out with friends which you preferred?

Therefore, we can now use this to our advantage and help us achieve our goals.

Stay Epic,
