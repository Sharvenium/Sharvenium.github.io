I have recently started my weekly email newsletter called &#8220;Sunday Stories&#8221; which you can sign up for and view previous issues [here.](http://sharvenium.substack.com)
Through the email newsletter I want to be able to share useful insights and links to interesting content that I consumed that week. Although, I have tried implementing these into my blog posts, I feel that they would be more suited for an email newsletter.

So if you fancy receiving an email from me every Sunday and falling into a rabbit-hole of interesting links of blogs, journals, podcasts, twitter threads, books or newsletters, then sign up [here](http://sharvenium.substack.com).

Stay Epic,  
Sharvenium
