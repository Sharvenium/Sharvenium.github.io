For the first time, I am writing this blog post in my local note-taking app. I used to use wordpress to write my blogs and _"design"_ my site using cool free themes that I find on the internet. But today, I have decided to take my first voyage into being tech independent and decided to create the entire site myself with help from the Jekyll static site builder. 

Here is a photo of my site before.

And here is a picture of my site now.

This new site is a static site. This means that the site is read only (as it has always been) which allows for it to be super snappy and quick when loading. I also made the homepage by myself using HTML and some CSS. The homepage is something that I am really proud of as it took a long time to make the orginal design in Figma before making it using basic HTML and CSS. 

Other parts of the website is made using Jekyll Now. I really like the default look but I did change a bit of the master css such as the orange accent colour and link hover box. like [this]({{site.baseurl}}/2.0)

Jekyll was hard to use at first but after using it for a couple of hours and navigating the default files, I learnt how to modify it to my own needs. One of the selling points of Jekyll is that it is really simple to use but you can modify it to your liking later on using Ruby. 

Now that the website redesign is done, I can now focus more on writing blog posts and book reviews. üòÅ
